        <p class="desc">Kurama is characterised as a snarky and shrewd individual. It uses "washi" (ワシ) when referring to itself, which is generally used by older men. Kurama expresses great pride in its power, believing itself to be the strongest of the tailed beasts due to its belief that their strength is determined by their number of tails, which earned Kurama nothing but disapproval from its brethren, especially Shukaku. The fox would also react out of jealousy whenever Naruto was not using its power</p>

                </div>
            </div>
        <p class="desc">Gyūki is characterised as a tough and serious individual. It uses "ore" (オレ) when referring to itself and often speaks in a somewhat rude dialect. Although Gyūki mentioned that it and its brethren disliked Kurama for its arrogance and belief that their strength are based on their number of tails, it insisted that was no reason for not helping Naruto Uzumaki to control Kurama's power, hinting a benevolent side. Since then, both Gyūki and B have taken a liking to Naruto.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
        <p class="desc">Though much has not been seen of Saiken's personality, the giant slug uses "ore" (オレ) when referring to itself, "ore" being a boastful way of saying "I". It also speaks with a dialect which may possibly be Ōsakaben in origin. In the anime, Saiken also seemed to be kinder and not as self-serving and malicious as most other tailed beasts, as when Utakata asked for its help to save Hotaru it seemed to willingly comply; and later it simply receded back into Utakata without trying to take him over.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
        <p class="desc">Son Gokū is a very prideful tailed beast, as it detests being called by the name "Four-Tails" and boasts about its lineage. It uses "ore" (オレ) when referring to itself. It also hated humans, due to the fact that humans had enslaved it, and believes that apes are more intelligent than humans. However, when talking about the Sage of Six Paths, it showed him great respect, being that also had, apparently, a very deep relationship with him, never forgetting his final words.</p>

            </div>
        <p class="desc">Shukaku is characterised as a childish and short-tempered individual, and often speaks in a bombastic and incoherent manner, giving it the demeanour of a drunkard. It uses "ore-sama" (オレ様, literally meaning: my esteemed self) when referring to itself, as it expresses great pride in its own abilities, especially its sealing techniques and defences.</p>
